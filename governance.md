gRPC is open source, and your contributions are welcome! All contributors must sign the [CNCF CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/projects/cncf). 

# Code of Conduct
The gRPC community abides by the CNCF [code of conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Here is an excerpt:

_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

As a member of the gRPC project, you represent the project and your fellow contributors.
We value our community tremendously and we'd like to keep cultivating a friendly and collaborative
environment for our contributors and users. We want everyone in the community to have
[positive experiences](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2016/12/14/diversity-scholarship-series-one-software-engineers-unexpected-cloudnativecon-kubecon-experience).

# How to Contribute

We welcome all PRs and encourage the community to file issues as needed. Sign the [CNCF CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/projects/cncf) and then jump in! Look for issues marked as "help wanted"; these are great to get started with. 
Discussion around project issues and proposals should take place on Github in the associated PR/issue/gRFC. We also encourage use of the [gRPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grpc-io), as well as our bi-weekly [community calls](https://www.meetup.com/gRPCio/). 

Non-coding contributions are greatly appreciated! These can include documentation, blog posts, talks, and meetups. 

All gRPC repos are governed by the [master contributing.md](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

# Community Meetings

We hold bi-weekly virtual meetings with the community. These provide a platform for discussing project status and the gRPC ecosystem as well as getting assistance with development issues. These meetings take place on Thursdays at 10:00am Pacific. [The meeting agenda](http://bit.ly/grpcmeetings) is owned by the community and you are encouraged to add your topics. 

# Add a New Feature

We use [gRFCs](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/README.md) for any substantial changes to gRPC. This process involves an upfront design that will provide increased visibility to the community. If you're considering a PR that will bring in a new feature across several languages, affect how gRPC is implemented, or may be a breaking change; then you should start with a gRFC. We've got the process documented in [/proposals](https://github.com/grpc/proposal) and have a [template](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/GRFC-TEMPLATE.md) for you to get started. 

# Become a Reviewer
